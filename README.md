# E-Commerse

This is an incompleted ecommerce project. There are a lot of things to do on it. Now, I'm developing it.

!!! This project is just a demonstration of my development skills in Laravel and Vue.js 3 (the project has not been completed yet).

# Installation

1. `git clone repo`
2. Set configs (mainly, database) to `.env` file
3. `composer install`
4. `php artisan key:generate`
5. `php artisan jwt:secret`
6. `php artisan migrate`
7. `php artisan db:seed`
